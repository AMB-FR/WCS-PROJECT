      <h2> About the Kingdom </h2>
      <p>
        In ancient geography, Colchis or Kolchis was an ancient Georgian kingdom
        and region[1] in the Caucasus, which played an important role in the
        ethnic and cultural formation of the Georgian nation[2] The Kingdom of
        Colchis as an early Georgian state contributed significantly in
        development of the medieval Georgian statehood after its unification
        with eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia-Kartli[3].<br />

        Now mostly the western part of Georgia, it was in Greek mythology the
        home of Aeëtes and Medea and the destination of the Argonauts, as well
        as being the possible homeland of the Amazons. The ancient area is
        represented roughly by the present day Georgian provinces of Mingrelia,
        Imereti, Guria, Ajaria, Svaneti, Racha, Abkhazia and the modern Turkey’s
        Rize Province and parts of Trabzon and Artvin provinces. One of the most
        important elements in the modern Georgian nation, the Colchians were
        probably established in the Caucasus by the Middle Bronze Age[4].
